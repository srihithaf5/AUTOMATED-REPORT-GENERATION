DESCRIPTION ABOUT THIS TASK

📄 Automated Report Generator

This project is developed as part of the CODTECH Internship – Task 2. The primary objective is to create an automated reporting system that reads structured data from a file, processes and analyzes it, and then generates a professionally formatted PDF report. Automating reports saves time, improves accuracy, and provides a reusable tool for any dataset analysis.

🚀 Features

This project comes with several useful features designed to make reporting simple yet effective:

CSV Data Input – Reads structured tabular data directly from CSV files.

Data Analysis – Performs statistical analysis such as total row count, mean, sum, and count for numeric columns.

Summary Generation – Automatically generates a concise summary section for key metrics.

Visualization – Uses Matplotlib to create bar chart visualizations for better understanding.

PDF Report Creation – Generates a clean and formatted PDF file using fpdf2, containing:

1.Title and metadata

2.Summary statistics

3.Graphical visualizations

Reusable & Extendable – Can be easily customized for different datasets and report requirements.

🖥️ Usage
To run the project, follow these steps:

Clone or download this repository.

Install required dependencies:

bash

pip install pandas matplotlib fpdf

Run the script with the following command:

bash

python scripts/minimal_report.py data/sample_data.csv outputs/sample_report.pdf

Input: A CSV file with structured data (e.g., name, region, sales, units).

Output: A PDF file stored in the outputs/ folder.

📊 Example

Input Data (data/sample_data.csv):

name,region,sales,units

Alice,North,1200.5,10

Bob,South,980.0,8

Charlie,East,1400.0,12

Diana,West,600.0,5

Output Report (outputs/sample_report.pdf):

Cover page with report title.

Summary section:

Sales → count, mean, sum

Units → count, mean, sum

Visualization: A bar chart comparing sales and units.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3 – Core programming language.

pandas – For reading and analyzing CSV data.

matplotlib – For creating bar chart visualizations.

fpdf2 – For generating PDF reports.

📌 Deliverables

✅ Python Script → scripts/minimal_report.py

✅ Sample Dataset → data/sample_data.csv

✅ Generated Report → outputs/sample_report.pdf

✅ Project Documentation → README.md

📖 Detailed Description

The Automated Report Generator is designed to demonstrate how data can be transformed into meaningful insights through automation. In many industries, analysts and professionals spend hours preparing reports by manually copying values from spreadsheets, calculating statistics, and formatting documents. This project eliminates that effort by automating the entire process.

When you provide a CSV file as input, the script first loads the data into memory using pandas. It then analyzes the numeric fields, calculating metrics such as total rows, mean, sum, and count. These insights are stored and later added into the PDF report under the “Summary” section.

To make the report more interactive and informative, a bar chart visualization is created using matplotlib. For example, in the provided dataset, the chart compares the sales and units of different individuals across regions. Visual data representation helps readers quickly understand trends and comparisons.

Once the analysis is complete, the script uses fpdf2 to create a structured PDF document. The report contains:

A title with proper formatting.

A summary section listing calculated statistics.

A graphical visualization embedded as an image.

The generated PDF can be used directly for business reporting, academic purposes, or project documentation.

Another advantage of this project is modularity. Users can easily extend the script to include:

More complex statistical measures (e.g., median, standard deviation).

Multiple types of charts (line, pie, histogram).

Automatic email delivery of reports.

Integration with databases or APIs for live reporting.

This makes the project not just a simple internship task but a scalable reporting tool that can be applied to real-world scenarios.

In summary, this project highlights the importance of automation in data reporting. It improves efficiency, reduces errors, and ensures consistency in the generated reports. By combining Python, pandas, matplotlib, and fpdf2, the project successfully demonstrates how raw data can be turned into professional reports with minimal effort.
